üê∑ Pig Latin Activity
Oday ouyay eakspay igpay atinlay?

In this activity we're going to create an application that translates regular English words into Pig Latin.

üí¨ Rules of Pig Latin
For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
"y" is treated like a vowel in appropriate circumstances.
There are many examples of Pig Latin translators out there on the internet to give you inspiration.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started
This is a very difficult problem to solve. Take the time to plan your approach and brainstorm with your team.

This project is going to utilize React for the UI and the JavaScript logic. There is already some code inside the React application that will provide a UI for the Pig Latin project. Your job is to create the logic. All the code you'll need to write for this app is going to be inside one function in the /src/App.js file.

After you accept the assignment from GitHub Classroom, you'll want to install all the necessary dependencies.

$ cd pig-latin-challenge
$ yarn
Then you are ready to start a server to run the application.

$ yarn start
Now you're ready to code!

To get started, find the myPigLatinCodeHere function, and write your code. Every time you save your updated file, the browser window displaying your app will reload.
